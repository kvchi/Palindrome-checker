✅ Project #2 – Palindrome Checker 🚀

Continuing my journey as a Front-End Developer, I built a simple but functional **Palindrome Checker** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What it does:
💬 Type a word → it checks if it’s a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward)
🧠 Includes logic to ignore case and spacing
🎨 Styled with a clean glassmorphism design

🧪 What I learned:
- How to use DOM manipulation effectively
- Writing cleaner conditionals with the ternary operator
- Practicing modular, readable JavaScript functions

Every day, one small app — consistency over complexity.
